## EGN6217 Applied Deep Learning | Spring 2026

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for **EGN6217 Applied Deep Learning**. This repository serves as the central hub for all course materials, including resources, lecture presentations, and laboratory assignments for the Spring 2026 semester.

Students are expected to interact with this repository regularly throughout the course.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository is designed to support the course in three primary ways:

1. Hosting course resources and reference materials  
2. Providing access to lecture presentations and supporting content  
3. Serving as the source location for laboratory assignments that students will clone and complete individually  

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders.

### 📁Resources

This folder contains supporting materials used throughout the course, including references, datasets, and supplementary readings that complement lecture and lab activities.

### 📁Presentations

This folder includes lecture slides and presentation materials used during scheduled class meetings.

### 📁Labs

This folder contains the laboratory assignments for the course.  
Labs are released progressively during the semester.

When a lab is assigned, students should clone the corresponding lab folder into their own working environment and complete the work independently.
